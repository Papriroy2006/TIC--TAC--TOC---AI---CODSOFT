Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the Tic Tac Toe AI code along with its functionalities and main components:

1. **Pygame Setup**:
   - Pygame is initialized to create the game window and handle events like mouse clicks, key presses, and quitting.

2. **Classes**:
   - **Board**: Manages the game board, including marking squares, checking for wins/draws, and providing available empty squares.
   - **AI**: Handles AI logic for making moves. It includes methods for random moves and minimax algorithm for more strategic moves.
   - **Game**: Controls the game flow, including player turns, checking for game over conditions, drawing the game grid, making moves, and resetting the game.

3. **Draw Methods**:
   - Methods for drawing the game grid, crosses, and circles on the screen using Pygame's drawing functions.

4. **Other Methods**:
   - Methods for making moves, switching player turns, changing game mode (Player vs. Player or Player vs. AI), checking if the game is over, and resetting the game.

5. **Main Functionality**:
   - The main loop continuously listens for events such as mouse clicks, key presses, and quitting the game.
   - Players can switch game modes (PvP or PvAI) using the 'g' key and restart the game using the 'r' key.
   - Players can also change the AI difficulty level (random or minimax) using the '0' and '1' keys.
   - When a player makes a move, the game updates the board, checks for a win/draw, and switches to the next player's turn.
   - If the game mode is set to AI and it's the AI's turn, it calculates the best move using either a random move or the minimax algorithm and makes the move.

Overall, this code creates a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent that can play at different difficulty levels. Players can interact with the game using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
